# `bitty-compat-lab`

> Independent validation suite (relocated out of the `bitty` workspace by
> W-105, bitty CTX-0931). Canonical product and architecture
> documentation lives in `bitty-terminal-docs` and shared governance in
> `bitty-docs`; this file is a crate-local map, not a canonical contract.

## Purpose

`bitty-compat-lab` is the standalone integration point for the headless,
bounded terminal-compatibility lab: it lets `cargo test -p bitty-compat-lab`
and `cargo test --workspace` exercise the lab without relying on
workspace-root test discovery. It re-exports the canonical harness, carries
the release compatibility matrix plus compare and report helpers, and ships
binaries for collecting dumps and rendering reports. Production crates are
consumed at a pinned immutable `bitty` revision (see `Cargo.toml`); this
crate is never a product-workspace member and is never linked into a
product artifact.

## Boundaries

- Pinned-revision production dependencies, per `Cargo.toml`: `bitty-vt` and
  `bitty-term-state`, plus a dev-dependency on `bitty-pty`; no
  network-facing dependency is declared.
- Does not own the harness source of truth: the canonical harness stays at
  `tests/compat/harness.rs` in the repository root and is re-exported through
  a path module (see `src/lib.rs`).
- Matrix entries map to bounded corpora plus deterministic state hashes; see
  `src/matrix.rs` for the exact shape. No window system, GPU, network, or RNG
  participates.

## Layout

- `Cargo.toml` — package metadata and pinned-revision production dependencies.
- `src/lib.rs` — crate docs, workspace-root path helpers, harness re-export.
- `src/matrix.rs` — release compatibility matrix over surfaces and terminals.
- `src/compare.rs` — differential comparison helpers.
- `src/report.rs` — report rendering helpers.
- `src/oracle.rs` — M1 differential oracle corpus (CTX-0573): scenario
  discovery, externally derived expectations, runner, and summary JSON.
- `src/bin/collect_dumps.rs` — dump-collection binary.
- `src/bin/compat_report.rs` — report binary.
- `src/bin/oracle_runner.rs` — M1 differential oracle runner (CTX-0573).
- `tests/` — lab integration tests (`compat_matrix`, `compare`, `report`,
  `harness`, `oracle`, `live_compat`, `dogfooding_corpus`).

## Differential oracle (CTX-0573)

`src/oracle.rs` plus `src/bin/oracle_runner.rs` implement the M1 differential
oracle corpus: each scenario under `tests/compat/oracle/scenarios/` carries
structured provenance — an `authority` from the closed `AUTHORITIES` set and a
verbatim `cite` token from that exact source (xterm `ctlseqs.txt` and
`charproc.c`, the ghostty/kitty reference trees, and the accepted RFCs) — never
Bitty's own output. The committed `tests/compat/oracle/authority-cites.txt`
index plus `oracle_citations_are_backed_by_their_authority` reject a
mis-citation. A `state` engine replays bytes through `bitty-vt`/`bitty-term-state`;
a `runtime` engine drives `bitty-runtime` for OSC 10/11 query replies and mouse
coordinate emission. Run `cargo test -p bitty-compat-lab --test oracle --locked`
or `cargo run -p bitty-compat-lab --bin oracle_runner --locked`; see
`tests/compat/oracle/README.md` for layout, provenance, and how to extend.
