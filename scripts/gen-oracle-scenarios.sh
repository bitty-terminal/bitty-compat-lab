# gen-oracle-scenarios.sh — author the CTX-0573 differential oracle corpus.
#
# W-105 relocation (bitty CTX-0931): moved with the corpus it authors from the
# bitty repository. Run from this repository root; `dir`/`cite_index` below
# resolve to `tests/compat/oracle/` here. The `docs_source` fallback reads the
# pinned bitty-terminal-docs blobs: set BITTY_TERMINAL_DOCS to that checkout
# (there is no docs submodule mount in this repository).
#
# Writes the raw VT scenario bytes (`*.bin`) and their externally derived
# expectations (`*.expected`) under `tests/compat/oracle/scenarios/`.
#
# Every expectation carries STRUCTURED provenance: an `authority:` naming one
# of the closed set in `crates/bitty-compat-lab/src/oracle.rs` (`AUTHORITIES`)
# and a `cite:` holding a verbatim token from that authority which defines the
# exercised behavior. The citation index
# (`tests/compat/oracle/authority-cites.txt`) records every accepted pair; the
# `oracle_citations_are_backed_by_their_authority` guard requires each pair to
# be indexed and, when the source is present, re-finds the token verbatim. A
# mis-citation (for example citing ctlseqs for DECSET 2026, which ctlseqs does
# not define — it is ghostty `synchronized_output`) therefore fails instead of
# being rubber-stamped.
#
# Re-running this script reproduces the corpus byte-identically EXCEPT the
# `authority-cites.txt` index, which is committed separately (see `write_cite`
# below; it is rewritten from the same source of truth). Run from the repo root.
